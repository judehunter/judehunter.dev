So, don't freak out, but TypeScript's type system is advanced enough to be able to **host entire languages inside of it**, using template literal types, among other techniques.

This has been done before, to varying degrees of insanity. SQL parser, etc.

As this is some mind-bogglingly crazy stuff, I had to start by testing if it's even possible. I wanted to keep my brain pure from any influence and try to (re)invent this on my own, and so I did not check the source of code of any of the mentioned projects.

I also wanted the code not to be a complete spaghetti trainwreck. So I laid out the usual parts of the compiler, the lexer, parser, and a tree-walking interpreter. I knew I would need a lot of string manipulation and transformation, so I began writing up some utility functions, such as `Trim` and `Split`

it will even have precedence parsing

For the parser, a classic recursive descent seemed like the perfect choice.

One problem was left-associativity

incredible complexity can arise from a set of simple rules. In this case, a set of simple features.

`a-b-` is possible because `${string}` matches ``
```tsx

```


error handling is possible

For long now, Binaryen has been the only tool to generate WebAssembly programmatically. C developers could call methods to generate and optimize a WASM module. JavaScript developers had to rely on `binaryen.js`, a machine generated port, with minimal documentation, outdated typing, and many little quirks and even bugs. Other language developers had to rely on more niche ports, or nothing at all.

[Wazum](https://github.com/judehunter/wazum "Wazum GitHub") is my attempt to bring a better DX into the WebAssembly field. It will function as a `binaryen.js` alternative with stellar documentation, **strong** typing, full test coverage, quality of life features, and a focus on usability for both compilation and hand-writing of WebAssembly.

Wazum would still use `binaryen.js` for the optimization part, but it would generate the WebAssembly textual format (WAT) by itself.

Here's an example of how one might define a simple function with wazum:

```markdown
ts
w.func(
  'add',
  {
    params: [
      ['i32', 'a'],
      ['i32', 'b'],
    ],
    locals: [['i32', 'ret']],
    returnType: 'i32',
  },
  w.block(null, 'i32', [
    w.drop(
      w.add(
        'i32',
        w.local.get('i32', 'a'),
        w.local.get('i32', 'b')
      )
    ),
    w.local.set(
      'i32',
      'ret',
      w.add(
        'i32',
        w.local.get('i32', 'a'),
        w.local.get('i32', 'b')
      ),
    ),
    w.local.get('i32', 'ret'),
  ]),
);
```

Notice the multiple datatype (`i32`) definitions. This was a design choice to maxime correctness over type inference. For instance, the type system will not allow you to call

```javascript
ts
w.add(
  'i32',
  w.local.get('i64', 'a'),
  // ERR: `i64` is not assignable to `i32`
  w.local.get('i32', b)
)
```

Additionally, wazum encourages the usage of named locals. Binaryen on the other hand only allows numeric indexes.

Wazum will not restrict any user from manipulating the generated tree. You'd be able to assemble the whole node tree for functions and their bodies first *(maybe manipulate them, duplicate functions, reuse subtrees, dynamically change some stuff, etc.)*, and only then add your functions to the module.

Binaryen on the other hand works in a sort of roundabout way. This is what roughly happens there:

```markdown
ts
// binaryen.js user calls a function:
i32.local.get(0);
// binaryen creates a representation for the
// `get 0` operation internally
// then, it stores that representation in an internal
// list and only returns its index, making it
// impossible for users to modify the representation

// this operation in binaryen:
i32.add(i32.local.get(0), i32.local.get(1))
// will first become this:
i32.add(123, 456)
// and then this
789
```

In comparison, the functions in wazum simply return the whole representation allowing the user to have maximum control and flexibility.

```markdown
ts
i32.add(i32.local.get('a'), i32.local.get('b'))
// becomes:
{
  __nodeType: 'add',
  dataType: 'i32',
  left: {
    __nodeType: 'localGet',
    dataType: 'i32',
    name: 'a',
  },
  right: {
    __nodeType: 'localGet',
    dataType: 'i32',
    name: 'b',
  },
}
```

***

At this point, wazum is still very much in its initial phases.

Thanks for reading. Stay tuned for more updates.
